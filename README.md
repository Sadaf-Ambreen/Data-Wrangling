Introduction


* Data wrangling is a critical step in preparing datasets for analysis, and handling duplicates plays a key role in ensuring data accuracy.
* Data wrangling is the process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing data to make it suitable for analysis. Finding and handling missing values is a crucial step in this process to ensure data accuracy and completeness.

3-Remove duplicate values strategically based on specific criteria.

4-Outline the process of verifying and documenting duplicate removal.



In Lab 7-Removing Duplicates,you will perform the following:

1-Identify duplicate rows in the dataset.

2-Use suitable techniques to remove duplicate rows and verify the removal.

3-Summarize how to handle missing values appropriately.

4-Use ConvertedCompYearly to normalize compensation data.


In  Lab 8 - Finding Missing Values, you will perform the following:

1-Identify missing values in the dataset.

2-Quantify missing values for specific columns.

3-Impute missing values using various strategies.


In Lab 9 - Impute Missing Values, you will perform the following:

1-Identify missing values in the dataset.

2-Apply techniques to impute missing values in the dataset.
